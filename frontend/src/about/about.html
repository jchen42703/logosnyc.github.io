            Logos Community Church (LCC or Logos, pronounced LAH-gahss, for short) is a thriving non-denominational
            church called to worship God in spirit and truth, to nurture the spiritual growth of believers, and to
            spread the mercies of God and gospel of Jesus Christ to the community.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are one church with two congregations organized by language (English and Chinese). This site is dedicated
            to the announcements, news, and events of the English Ministry. Our English Ministry community is made up of
            individuals ranging from youth to families with children.

        <p>
            The vision of LCC is to be a church that nurtures God’s children through God’s Word and brings God’s love
            and salvation to individuals and communities, both locally and globally.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mission of LCC is to build God-centered disciples who live out God’s Word and to lead people to Christ.

        <span>Pastor Keith</span>
        <span id="position">English Ministry Pastor</span>
        <p>
            Keith has served on staff as the English Ministry Pastor at Logos Community Church since its inception a few
            years ago. Prior to entering full-time ministry, Keith worked as a structural engineer for many years and
            then attended Alliance Theological Seminary for his Master of Divinity. However, rather than hanging up
            AutoCAD for a Bible, God has continued to use Keith’s skills and experiences as a structural engineer in his
            ministry through the construction and renovation of Logos’ new building.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Outside of church, Keith spends his time with his wonderful wife, Stephanie, their two grown kids, Jessie
            and Will, and their dog, Truffle. He can also be found playing basketball during open gym and cheering on
            the church’s basketball teams during the winter and summer tournaments. If you ever need to find him, look
            for his trademark green mug with the orange cap, filled with water – his preferred drink of choice.

        <p>
            Sensing God’s call to ministry, Mary attended Alliance Theological Seminary for her Master of Divinity. She
            currently serves with the college fellowship at Logos. While not working directly with college students,
            Mary continues to serve God through her passion for worship leading and missions, having served in places
            like Romania.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Mary resides in Long Island with her husband, Samuel, and her son, Hananiah, and spends most of her days
            between the excitement and hard work of ministry and motherhood.
