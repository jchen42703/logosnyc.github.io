            Our youth fellowship consists of middle and high school students who
            attend various schools in Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, and Long Island.
            Friday Fellowship is one of the best connection points for students
            with the church and an opportunity for them to encounter Christ
            alongside their peers in an open, fun, and challenging environment.
            A typical evening includes worship, games, teaching, and small
            groups.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>The youth fellowship meets on Fridays at 7:30 PM in the Chapel.</p>

            Our college fellowship consists of students who attend schools
            across New York as well as out of state students who return during
            their breaks. The college fellowship seeks to be a place where
            students can discover what it means to follow Christ and how to
            align their vocation as a student with God as they encounter new
            freedoms, decisions, and responsibilities.

          <p>The college fellowship meets on Fridays at 7:30 PM in Room 204.</p>

          <p>
            Our career fellowship consists of young adults and adults (20’s to
            30’s) who are navigating a particularly transitory stage of their
            life. Some transition from one career to another. Others transition
            from singleness to marriage. In career fellowship, brothers and
            sisters find a community that seeks to challenge them to walk in a
            manner worthy of the gospel and the calling to which they have
            received as followers of Jesus Christ.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>The career fellowship meets on Fridays at 7:30 PM in Room 203.</p>

            Our family fellowship consists of parents with children ranging from
            infants to teens. The fellowship seeks to help families form their
            identity in God through understanding God’s purposes for families,
            parenting, and marriage. We meet to learn what the Bible says about
            these issues and to read Christian books on marriage and parenting.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The family fellowship meets every third Saturday at 6:30 PM in Room
            C03.
