        <div class="our-staff-description">
            <p>Keith has served on staff as the English Ministry Pastor at Logos Community Church since its
                inception a few years ago. Prior to entering full-time ministry, Keith worked as a structural
                engineer for many years and
                then attended Alliance Theological Seminary for his Master of Divinity.
                However, rather than hanging up
                AutoCAD for a Bible, God has continued to use Keith’s skills and experiences as a structural
                engineer in his ministry through the construction and renovation of Logos’ new building.</p>
