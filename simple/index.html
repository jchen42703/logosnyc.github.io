      <h3>What can I expect when I arrive on Sunday?</h3>
      <p>
        Join us for worship service at 11:15 AM at our new 171 Building,
        followed by lunch. Feel free to come a little earlier and meet with one
        of our welcome team members!
      </p>
      <h3>What’s for lunch?</h3>
      <p>
        Lunch is a time for everyone at Logos to fellowship over food. Our lunch
        team orders in local Chinese takeout. First-time visitors eat free!
      </p>
      <h3>Is there childcare?</h3>
      <p>
        Our amazing volunteers serve every Sunday to help run our children’s
        ministry. We have programs for children from kindergarten to middle
        school starting at 11:30 AM. Drop off is at 11:15 AM and pick up is at
        1:00 PM. For more information on this ministry, check out our page on
        children and youth. Parents with toddlers and pre-k children can bring
        them to the designated area in the back of the Sanctuary on the first
        floor. Parents with infants may bring them to our service where there is
        space in the last few rows for parents who may need to step out briefly
        to tend to their children.
      </p>
      <h3>Do I have to stand when you welcome newcomers?</h3>
      <p>
        Definitely not! We do not want to have you do something which you’re not
        comfortable with. Standing allows our welcome team and the rest of the
        congregation to acknowledge and welcome you in case they missed you on
        the way in. If you prefer not to stand, please don’t hesitate to
        introduce yourselves to our pastoral staff, our welcome team, or those
        around you.
      </p>
      <h3>What is your preaching and worship style?</h3>
      <p>
        Our services consists of contemporary worship followed by a message from
        God’s Word.
      </p>
      <!-- Not finished -->
      <h3>How long are your services? What happens during service?</h3>
      <p>
        Our services are approximately 75 minutes long, and consists of four
        parts:
      </p>
      <h4>Worship</h4>
      <p>
        God has called us not just to know Him, but to worship Him. The worship
        part of our service is a time where we sing songs that are chosen to
        give praise to Him, and to express our love for Him and His love for us.
        We do our best to select songs that are God-centered, theologically
        sound, and musically accessible.
      </p>

      <h3>What should I wear to service?</h3>
      <p>
        Our services are quite casual. Some wear a t-shirt and jeans, while
        others wear a suit and tie. Whether you are wearing one or the other, we
        warmly welcome you to worship with us.
      </p>

      <h3>How often do you celebrate communion?</h3>
      <p>We celebrate communion on the first Sunday of every month.</p>
      <p>
        Communion is a time in which we, as followers of Jesus Christ, give
        thanks in remembrance of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross for our sins.
        Communion is reserved for those who have professed their faith in Jesus
        Christ publicly through baptism.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have not been baptized or have placed your faith in Jesus Christ,
        don’t hesitate to reach out to one of our pastoral staff or deacons, who
        can talk to you more about it.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I get baptized? Or become a member?</h3>
      <p>
        If you would like to be a candidate for baptism or membership, please
        come speak to one of our pastoral staff or deacons. The baptismal
        process includes an 8 week course, preparing a testimony, and a brief
        interview. For those who have been baptized and are interested in
        membership, the last 2 classes of the baptismal course are set aside for
        membership. The course is offered twice a year, once in the Fall and
        once in the Spring.
      </p>

      <h3>Is your church wheelchair accessible?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, it is! Our main entrance has a ramp for wheelchair use and there is
        an elevator located near the stairwell on the first floor that can take
        you to the basement or the second floor.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I get to church?</h3>
      <p>
        Our church is located at 43-00 171st Street, Flushing, NY 11358. We are
        located right off of Northern Blvd near Utopia Parkway. We are easily
        accessible from the I-295 Clearview Expressway and I-495 Long Island
        Expressway (LIE).
      </p>

      <h3>Where do I park?</h3>
      <p>Street parking is available on the numbered streets and avenues.</p>
      <h3>I’m completely lost. Where do I go?</h3>
      <p>
        No worries! Arriving at a new place with new people can be quite
        intimidating. Feel free to ask one of our welcome team members (they’re
        the ones wearing a name tag).
