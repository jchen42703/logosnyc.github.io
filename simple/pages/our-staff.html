            Keith has served on staff as the English Ministry Pastor at Logos Community Church since its inception a few
            years ago.
            <br>Prior to entering full-time ministry, Keith worked as a structural engineer for many years and
            then attended Alliance Theological Seminary for his Master of Divinity.
            <br> However, rather than hanging up
            AutoCAD for a Bible, God has continued to use Keith’s skills and experiences as a structural engineer
            <br> in his
            ministry through the construction and renovation of Logos’ new building.

            Sensing God’s call to ministry, Mary attended Alliance Theological Seminary for her Master of Divinity.
            <br>She currently serves with the college fellowship at Logos. While not working directly with college
            students,
            <br>Mary continues to serve God through her passion for worship leading and missions, having served in
            places
            like Romania.
