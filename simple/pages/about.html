                <h3 class="user-name">Pastor Keith</h3>
                <h5>English Ministry Pastor</h5>
                <p> Keith has served on staff as the English Ministry Pastor at Logos Community Church since its
                    inception a few years ago. Prior to entering full-time ministry, Keith worked as a structural
                    engineer for many years and
                    then attended Alliance Theological Seminary for his Master of Divinity.
                    However, rather than hanging up
                    AutoCAD for a Bible, God has continued to use Keith’s skills and experiences as a structural
                    engineer in his ministry through the construction and renovation of Logos’ new building.

                <h5>Lay Pastor</h5>
                <p>Sensing God’s call to ministry, Mary attended Alliance Theological Seminary for her Master of
                    Divinity. She currently serves with the college fellowship at Logos. While not working directly with
                    college students, Mary continues to serve God through her passion for worship leading and missions,
                    having served in places like Romania.
